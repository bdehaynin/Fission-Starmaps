# Fission-Starmap
Roadmap render of all Fission projects in one place

This repo hosts the root and milestones issues necessary to render Fission projects in Starmap. To access Starmap, click [here](https://starmap.site/roadmap/github.com/fission-codes/Fission-Starmap/issues/1#simple).

To access the project themselves, visit https://github.com/fission-codes

We are trying to have more PLN projects use Starmap to have everything in one place and be able to see inter-team dependencies more easily.

Note: This repository is subject to change as priorities and circumstances evolve.
